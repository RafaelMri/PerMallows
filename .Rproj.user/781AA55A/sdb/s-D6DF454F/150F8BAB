Lozano <ja.lozano@ehu.es>\nMaintainer: Ekhine Irurozki <ekhine.irurozqui@ehu.es>\nDescription: Includes functions to work with the Mallows, Generalized Mallows and Weighted Mallows Models. The considered distances are Kendall's-tau, Cayley, Hamming and Ulam and it includes functions for making inference, sampling and learning such distributions, some of which are novel in the literature. As a by-product, PerMallows also includes operations for permutations, paying special attention to those related with the Kendall's-tau, Cayley, Ulam and Hamming distances and the random generation of permutations. \nLicense: GPL (>= 2)\nDepends: Rcpp (>= 0.10.3)\nImports: utils\nLinkingTo: Rcpp",
